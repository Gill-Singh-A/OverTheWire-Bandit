# Level 8
The password for the next level is stored in a file named 'data.txt' and is the only line of text that occurs only once.<br /><br />

HOST = bandit.labs.overthewire.org<br />
PORT = 2220<br />
USERNAME = bandit8<br />
PASSWORD = TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP<br />
SERVICE = ssh<br /><br />

To log on the server using ssh, we simply have to type the command:
```bash
ssh user@host -p port
```
So after substituting the values, we get the following command:
```bash
ssh bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
After this we will be greeted with the following text:
```bash
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_ 
                        | '_ \ / _` | '_ \ / _` | | __|
                        | |_) | (_| | | | | (_| | | |_ 
                        |_.__/ \__,_|_| |_|\__,_|_|\__|
                                                       

                      This is an OverTheWire game server.

bandit8@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:

Here we have to give the password which is given above.<br />
After entering the password, we get the following text and access to the server's shell.
```bash

Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 Both python2 and python3 are installed.

bandit8@bandit:~$
```
Lets check the current working directory with 'pwd' command:
```bash
bandit8@bandit:~$ pwd
/home/bandit8
```
Here, we see that we're in the home directory of the bandit8 user, in which the 'data.txt' file is stored.<br />
Here, lets type 'ls -l' command to check out the files in the current directory.
```bash
bandit8@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 36
-rw-r----- 1 bandit9 bandit8 33033 Feb 21 22:03 data.txt
```
As given in the statement, that the password is the only line of text that occurs only once, that is, we have to find the unique line, we can use 'sort' command to get the file contents sorted and the 'uniq' command to filter out the unique occurence:
```bash
bandit8@bandit:~$ sort data.txt | uniq -u
EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t
```
Here, we got the password for the Level 9 of Bandit.<br />
So, our purpose is complete. Let's logout from the server using the 'exit' command
```bash
bandit8@bandit:~$ exit
logout
Connection to bandit.labs.overthewire.org closed.
```
<br />
Password for Level 9 = EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t
