# Level 13
The password for the next level is stored in '/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14' and can only be read by user 'bandit14'.<br />
For this level, we donâ€™t get the next password, but we get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.<br /><br />

HOST = bandit.labs.overthewire.org<br />
PORT = 2220<br />
USERNAME = bandit13<br />
PASSWORD = wbWdlBxEir4CaE8LaPhauuOo6pwRmrDw<br />
SERVICE = ssh<br /><br />

To log on the server using ssh, we simply have to type the command:
```bash
ssh user@host -p port
```
So after substituting the values, we get the following command:
```bash
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
After this we will be greeted with the following text:
```bash
                         _                     _ _ _   
                        | |__   __ _ _ __   __| (_) |_

bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org's password:

Here we have to give the password which is given above.<br />
After entering the password, we get the following text and access to the server's shell.

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)

 Both python2 and python3 are installed.

bandit13@bandit:~$
```
Lets check the current working directory with 'pwd' command:
```bash
bandit13@bandit:~$ pwd
/home/bandit13
```
Here, we see that we're in the home directory of the bandit13 user, in which the private SSH Key is stored.<br />
Here, lets type 'ls -l' command to check out the files in the current directory.
```bash
bandit13@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r----- 1 bandit14 bandit13 1679 Feb 21 22:02 sshkey.private
```
So, we have the private SSH Key to connect to the localhost for going to Level 14 of Bandit.<br />
So, let's use the 'ssh' command with the following arguments:
```bash
ssh bandit14@localhost -p 2220 -i sshkey.private
```
We get connected to User 'bandit14'
```bash
bandit13@bandit:~$ ssh bandit14@localhost -p 2220 -i sshkey.private

bandit14@bandit:~$
```
As password of Level 14 was stored in '/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14'.<br />
So let's read that file with 'cat' command
```bash
bandit14@bandit:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq
```
Here, we got the password for the Level 14 of Bandit.
But, we're currently in Level 14 of Bandit, so we should not exit until we've completed this level.<br />

Password for Level 14 = fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq
